# Contributing

Contribution is possible with reporting an issue or opening a pull request on the GitHub page of the repository. When contributing to EASYMORE, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with Shervan or Wouter. We can then try to fix the issue or ask for a pull request. 


## Pull Request Process

1. The pull request should be always directed to the `develop` branch. In specific situations, we can create a new branch for some specialized features/developments.
2. We prefer a larger number of pull requests with smaller changes in the code. This helps the code review and testing to be easier.
3. Each pull request should specify the reproducibility with the existing examples of the repository (or at least part of it).
4. The pull request will be merged after the code review, extensive testing, continuity with existing codes, and demands from the users. This might take some time!

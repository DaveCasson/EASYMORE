EASYMORE Function,Explanation
nc_remapper,"It executes the related functions to read and check the source NetCDF file, sink shapefiles, check their consistency, create the source shapefile if not provided, intersection and then remapping. For version 0.0.0 of EASYMORE, nc_remapper expect only shapefiles with WGS84 projection."
,
check_easymore_input ,It checks that the essential variables/objects presented in Table-1 are provided for nc_remapper are provided.
,
check_target_shp,"Check the target/sink shapefile and check the projections and field of latitude, longitude and ID."
,
get_col_row,"It returns a dataframe (.csv) of latitude, longitude and their row and column based interpreted for EASYMORE which can be used to create manual remapping or interpolation files."
check_source_nc,"It checks the availability of the variables, their consistent dimensions over (multiple) source file(s)."
check_source_nc_shp,It checks if the variable latitude and longitude are provided in the shapefile and dimension matches the source NetCDF file in case of irregular source NetCDF file.
NetCDF_SHP_lat_lon,It creates a mesh of 2D or 1D array of latitude and longitude based on the source shapefile. If case 1 and 2 then the output is a 2D array of latitude and longitude. And if case 3 then the output is a 1D array of latitude and longitude.
lat_lon_SHP,Create shapefile from the latitude and longitude provided by NetCDF_SHP_lat_lon function
expand_source_SHP,It expands the shapefile to -180 to 360 longitude
create_remap,It creates and save the remap file given the intersected shapefile.
create_row_col_df,It creates the row and col data for each pair of latitude and longitude from the source data.
check_easymore_remap,It checks EASYMORE remapping file for necessary existing fields. And remapping file should have the following fields for each intersected shape. ID_t: The ID of the target/sink shapefile lat_t: The latitude of the target/sink shapefile lon_t: The longitude of the target/sink shapefile ID_s: The ID of the source shapefile (not used) lat_s: The latitude of the source shapefile (and NetCDF source file) lon_s: The longitude of the source shapefile (and NetCDF source file) weight: The weight of each source shape in the sink/target shape

,
__target_nc_creation,It reads the source file and call the __weighted_average for averaging the 
__weighted_average,It does the weighted average based on the weights provided.
intersection_shp,"It intersects two geopandas dataframe with similar projection by calling spatioal_overlays. Additionally, it calculates the area of the source and sink shapefile and their intersection shapes and their percentage and normalized percentage. S_1_*: All the field from the first shapefile (sink/target) S_2_*: All the field from the second shapefile (source) AINT: The area of intersected shape AS1: The area of shapes from first shapefile AS2:  The area of shapes from the second shapefile AP1: The percentage of the area of intersected shapes in comparison to areas of shapes from first shapefile AP2: The percentage of the area of intersected shapes in comparison to areas of shapes from second shapefile AP1N: The normalized area based on AP1 (sum to 1) AP2N: The normalized area based on AP2 (sum to 1)"

spatial_overlays,It does the intersection of the shapefile. 
make_shape_point,"It creates a shapefile of points from a given latitude, longitude and ID 1-D arrays"
subbasin_creation,It creates subbasins for a given point shapefile (gauges) that should have the field ID as well
run_subbasin_creation,It creates the entire river network given a hydrologically conditioned DEM and 
dem_processing,It creates the flow direction and flow accumulation based on the package pysheds
river,It creates the river lines based on the package pysheds
river_network,"It creates the network topology and extract the needed information, maximum and minimum elevation and flow accumulation"
get_all_upstream,Get all the upstream segment of a river segment given the NTOPO and segment ID
get_all_downstream,Created the NTOPO which indicate the downstream of each segment in the river network topology
voronoi_diagram,It creates the Voronoi or Thiessen diagram given a point shapefile
extract_value_tiff,It extracts the values from a geotiff for a given location of a point shapefile
shp_dissolve,Merging shapes with similar characteristics into a unified multi-polygon
geotif2shp,Conversion of geotiff to shapefile
__geotif2shp_subfun,Sub function of geotiff conversion
geotif_zones,Zoning the geotiff values into a new raster
zonal_stat,Zonal statistics for a shapes in a shapefile given a geotiff file

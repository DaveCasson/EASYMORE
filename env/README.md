# Example of installing EASYMORE in a virtual environment
## Mac
The following commands can be executed on a Mac terminal.
First, we need to have GDAL source files. On Mac, this can be done by:
```brew install gdal```
If you already have installed gdal, you can create a virtual env. For this example we create the virtual environment by installing `virtualenv` first:
```
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv easymore
```
After the environment is created we can activate this virtual environment and check its information:
```
source easymore/bin/activate
```
We can then install easymore from PyPI:
```
pip install easymore
```
Or this can be done from the latest code from easymore GitHub repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/ShervanGharari/EASYMORE.git /path/to/easymore
pip install /path/to/easymore
```
In order to be able to run the examples with jupyter notebook, we need to install jupyter and ipykernel and link it to the virtual environment.
```
pip install jupyter
pip install ipykernel
ipykernel install --name=easymore-env # Add the new virtual environment to Jupyter
jupyter kernelspec list # list existing Jupyter virtual environments
```
The example can be tested by navigating to the examples folder of the cloned EASYMORE repo
```
cd /path/to/easymore/examples
jupyter notebook
```
Make sure the jupyter notebook kernel is the same as your env name.
Another way to run the example is to convert the jupyter notebook to python and simulate them as follow:
```
cd /path/to/easymore/examples
jupyter nbconvert *.ipynb --to python # converts all the files to .py
python 01_ERA5_Regular_Lat_Lon.py
```
**âš  ATTENTION:**
We highly recommend before using EASYMORE, the virtual environment is set up properly, and then the examples from the GitHub repository are tested to evaluate the authenticity of the results with what is generated by the EASYMORE development team.
In addition, we have provided an example of a requirements file that is tested with EASYMORE development team for Python 3.11.2 is provided. The users can install all the needed packages before installing EASYMORE by `pip install -r path/to/easymore/env/requirements_mac.txt`.
